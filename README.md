# Inventory Robot with UNO Q

## Introduction
This project will guide you on how to build your own **Inventory Robot** that can manage and track any item you want to store. It provides a simple and straightforward solution to automate, organize, and segregate your objects.
As a hobbyist, once you're done prototyping, it often becomes difficult to place every component back in its correct location. This robot solves that by automating the process of tracking and arranging items efficiently.

## Ok cool, but what will you learn from this project? You will learn:
1. How to train an ML model int **Edge Impulse**, optimize it in and integrate it into your **Arduino UNO Q app**.
3. Use the core feature of Arduino UNO Q, that is seamless communication from your software to hardware using the Bridge API.
4. Use this software solution for your own hardware setup.

**To help you build your complete solution I have also built the hardware for you with all the necessary hardware and STL files** <br>
**The Robot comprises of a very simple design and has been designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Arduino UNO Q and Edge Impulse for this Application**
