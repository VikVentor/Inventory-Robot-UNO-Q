# Smart Inventory Robot (Edeg Impulse + UNO Q)

## Introduction
This project will guide you on how to build your own **Inventory Robot** that can manage and track any item you want to store. It provides a simple and straightforward solution to automate, organize, and segregate your objects.
As a hobbyist, once you're done prototyping, it often becomes difficult to place every component back in its correct location. This robot solves that by automating the process of tracking and arranging items efficiently.

## Problem Understanding

When working on prototypes or hobby projects, components often end up scattered across the workspace. After completing a project, it becomes difficult to identify, sort, and return each item to its correct place. This leads to misplaced components, wasted time searching for parts, and an overall inefficient workflow.

Manual sorting and tracking of items is repetitive and prone to human error. As the number of components grows, maintaining a proper inventory becomes even harder.

The core problem is the lack of an easy, automated system that can:
- Identify items quickly  
- Count them accurately  
- Sort and place them in the right location  
- Keep a consistent record of what’s stored  

This project aims to eliminate these manual tasks by providing an automated, intelligent inventory robot powered by the Arduino UNO Q and Edge Impulse.

## Solution
Explain your overall solution approach.

## What You Will Learn
List the key learning points.
1. How to train an ML model int **Edge Impulse**, optimize it in and integrate it into your **Arduino UNO Q app**.
3. Use the core feature of Arduino UNO Q, that is seamless communication from your software to hardware using the Bridge API.
4. Use this software solution for your own hardware setup.

**To help you build your complete solution I have also built the hardware for you with all the necessary hardware and STL files** <br>
**The Robot comprises of a very simple design and has been designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Arduino UNO Q and Edge Impulse for this Application**
